# Investigate a Dataset
Project 1 in ALX-T Data Analyst Nanodegree Program, Udacity.

## Project Overview
![The Movie Database Image](https://miro.medium.com/max/400/1*Y9-6_bh5a00rJWWoQ28NMQ.jpeg)

I analyzed the dataset (The Movie Database [TDMB]) and then communicated my findings. I used Python libraries Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.
Hundreds of movies are released every year, but not all are profitable. The aim is to bring out insights from the TDMB dataset, which has details about each movie, such as revenue cost, budget, vote_count, and other information.

## Package Required
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* csv

## Some Findings
Movie Popularity
